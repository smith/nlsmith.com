Welcome!

I've decided to start writing a blog here. One of the wonderful things about
being a software engineer is being able to learn something new every day.

I write a lot of JavaScript and React, and hopefully I can find interesting things to share.

The blog platform is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [Microsoft Office UI Fabric](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/), and hosted on [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) using [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) as a CDN.

I'll be writing and sharing things as I go here. Let's learn something together!
