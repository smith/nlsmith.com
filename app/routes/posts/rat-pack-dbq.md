These are the slides for [a talk I gave at the Dubuque Software Development User Group](https://www.meetup.com/dbqINETA/events/263201144/) about using React, Apollo, and TypeScript together.

This talk was given at [Clarke University](https://www.clarke.edu/). I'd been to Dubuque before, but never heard of Clarke. It's a Catholic liberal arts college. Beautiful campus.

The venue for the event was the Keller Computer Center, which was named after [Mary Kenneth Keller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Kenneth_Keller), who was the first woman to get a Ph.D. in computer science and founded the computer science department at Clarke. She helped create BASIC!
